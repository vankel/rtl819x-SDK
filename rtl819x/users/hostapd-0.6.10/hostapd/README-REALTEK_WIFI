Introduction 
	This document is the guideline for building/using/porting the Hostapd 
application to support Realtek's Wifi device.

==================================================================================

1.Build the hostapd daemon 
-----------------------------
	If the Wifi device is connected to your platform using GMII/MII interface
then the inband libary must be built and enabled in hostapd.control. Please follow 
the steps below to build the hostapd daemon.()

    a. Build the inband libary (#This step can be skipped,if you dont need inband-cotrol)
	
	- Enter the inband_dir directory.(default:../../inband_dir)
	
	- Modify the definition of CC and LD in /inband_lib/Makefile to fit your
        toolchain setting.

	- type make and the inband.a libray will be built on your platform. 
	
    b. Enable/Disable the inband-control support in Hostapd.    
	
        - Enable the lines below in hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd/Makefile to enable the 
	inband-support.In the other hand,disable these lines to disable the inband-control.

	CFLAGS += -DINBAND_CTRL
	CFLAGS += -I../../inband_lib
	LIBS += ../../inband_lib/inband.a

    c. Make the Hostapd	
	
	- enter the directory : hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd/
	
	- Modify hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd/Makefile to include your openssl libary.Below 
	lines are the default setting in Realtek's WIFI-AP SDK.

	LIBS += -ldl ../../openssl-0.9.8b/libssl.a ../../openssl-0.9.8b/libcrypto.a
        LIBS_p += ../../openssl-0.9.8b/libcrypto.a
        LIBS_h += ../../openssl-0.9.8b/libcrypto.a

	- Modify the definition of CC and LD in hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd/Makefile to 
	  fit your toolchain setting.

	- type 'make' under hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd ,then the hostapd daemon will be built. 

NOTEs:
	-  Because of the ethernet type 0x8899 and 0x9000 is used for inband control 
	please do not use them in other applications.
	
	- The default local interface for inband control is "br0', you can change the definition
	in drv_realtek.c(the line list below) to fit your MII interface setting.
	
		#define INBAND_INTF             "br0"

	- The default MAC address for inband-control  is "00:12:34:56:78:99", it
	 can be changed in drv_realtek.c.

==================================================================================

2.Realtek proprietary configuration options
----------------------------
	  
	- Please refer to file hostapd.test_conf(under hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd/conf)
	 for detail descriptions about the new added realtek private configurations. All these 
	 configurations are directly mapped to realtek WiFi mibs.

	- Other inherently hostapd configurations are same as before.

	- 'auth_algs' has new values for supporting Open Networking & WEP+802.1x
	 	 ## ======== Modify auth_algs support==========
		 ## bit 0 = Open System Authentication
		 ## bit 1 = Shared Key Authentication (requires WEP)
		 ## bit 0 + bit 1 = Auto WEP mode
		 ## bit 2 = WEP + 802.1x
		 ## bit 3 = Open Networking(no security)

	- These hostapd configuration files(under /hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd/conf) can be examples for testing
	      - hostapd.none_security   :WPS configured, Open Networking.
	      - hostapd.wpa_psk         :WPS configured, WPA-PSK CCMP.
	- NOT Supported yet:
    	      - Some IEEE 802.11 related configurations
      	      - IEEE 802.11r configuration
              - Passive scanning
              - Multiple BSSID support 


==================================================================================

3.Porting notes
-----------------------------	 
	The Hostapd for Realtek WiFi device is based on hostapd 0.6.10 and patch the realtek's implementation. 
Some notes are listed below to help you to port this package to your platform(for example , 
you are using hostapd 0.6.9 on your platform not 0.6.10). 

	- Driver_realtek.c & Driver_realtek.h under /hostapd-0.6.10/hostapd are the main added files 
	for supporting realtek WiFi device. 

	- Other modifications about Hostapd-0.6.10 were labeled with compile tag 'RTK_HAPD'. 
	You can check these patches by searching the keyword 'RTK_HAPD'.

	-  List of modified source files in hostapd v0.6.10:
	      - Config.c  
	      - Driver.h
	      - Hostapd.c
	      - Hostapd.h
	      - Iapp.c
	      - Os_unix.c
	      - Wps.h
	      - Wps_hostapd.c
	      - Wps_registrar.c
	      - Wps_upnp_event.c
	      - Wps_upnp_web.c
