OpenCapWap 0.93.3 - 02/12/2009
Donato Capitella - d.capitella@gmail.com

This version adds a vendor specific WTP Update System together with
some minor bugfixes. 

*----------------------------*
|      WTP Update System     |
*----------------------------*
The update system consists of a tool used AC-side to send
updates (wum) and an update agent (WUA) executed WTP-side which
takes care of installing an update package. 

*** WUA ***
The WUA can be compiled like this:

$ make WUA 

Once compiled, it has to be reside in the same directory as the WTP binary.

*** wum ***
The wum commmad source code is located in the /wum sub-directory. To 
compile it, just cd into /wum and then execute 'make'. This command
can be installed anywhere on the AC machine and it relies on the
AC Interface to operate.

For further information about the update system and how update packages
are biult, refer to the document WTPUpdateSystem.pdf in the /docs sub-directory 
in this source tree.

*---------------------------*
Note about log location
*---------------------------*
From this version on, WTP and AC logs are stored in /var/log/.
This behaviour can be changed editing the header files CWAC.h and
CWWTP.h before building Open CAPWAP.
