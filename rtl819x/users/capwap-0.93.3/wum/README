WUM - WTP Update Manager

Wum (WTP Update Manager) is the command line tool used to send update
requests to the WTPs. Of course it is executed on the AC machine and interacts
with the AC Interface.

To compile it, just run 'make'.

For further details about how to use it, refer to the document WTPUpdateSystem.pdf
in the docs sub-directory of this source tree.
