What it is
==========

USB_ModeSwitch is (surprise!) a small mode switching tool for controlling
"flip flop" (multiple mode) USB gear.

Several new USB devices (especially high-speed WAN stuff, based on cell phone
chipsets containing that feature) have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when
plugged in for the first time they act like a flash storage and start
installing the driver from there.
After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) the driver switches the
mode internally, the storage device vanishes (in most cases), and a new device
(like an USB modem) shows up. Modem maker "Option" calls that feature "ZeroCD
(TM)".

In the beginning, nothing of this was documented in any form and there was
hardly any Linux support available.
On the good side, most of the known devices work out of the box in all modes
with the available Linux modules like "usb-storage" or serial USB drivers.
That leaves only the problem of the mode-switching from storage to whatever
the thing is supposed to do.

Fortunately there are things like human intelligence, USB sniffing programs and
"libusb". It is possible to eavesdrop the communication of the MS Windows
driver, to isolate the command or action that does the switching, and to replay
the same thing with Linux.

USB-ModeSwitch eases the pain considerably by taking just the important para-
meters from a configuration file and doing all the initialization and communi-
cation stuff, with heavy help from "libusb".
It is mainly used automatically - via udev events and rules - to do the switch
without any user interaction. But it can also be run as a command line tool,
usually when trying to make it work with unknown devices.

We have already collected a wide range of information on how to switch all
sorts of devices. If you run into a new one that is unknown yet, don't despair:
we can find out what you need to do!


How to install
==============

!! You need the usb-modeswitch-data package from the same source as this !!

If you have an earlier version installed, de-installation is recommended ("make
uninstall"). The wrapper script location changed in 1.1.0, old ones might be
orphaned in /usr/sbin.

Important: you need "tcl" for the wrapper script to work; if you enter "tclsh"
and you get a "%" prompt, you are set (to exit type "exit"). The "tcl" package
is part of all distributions I know.

To install, unpack and in the new directory use this line at the shell (as root):

> make install

This installs a wrapper script, a global config file, the binary and a man page.

Install the data package as well, and you are set already; if your device is
known, you should be able to just plug it and use it. If it doesn't work we'll
find out why.


For manual use just run "make". Work with the command line interface or
with a setup file. You can use any file and give its path with the "-c"
parameter.
The file named "device_reference.txt" that you can find in this package is
a device and configuration reference containing most known devices; you can
use it as a base to create your own configuration file.
It's heavily commented and should tell you what to do.

Run "usb-modeswitch -h" to list the command line parameters. If any of them
except -W and -q are used, the default config file in /etc is NOT read.
See also the provided man page.

To run the program use it from the source folder or put it somewhere into your
path (preferably "/sbin" or "/usr/sbin").

Note: manual use is intended for testing and analyzing !

Once your new device is switching fine you can add a rule entry to the rules
file to let udev run usb-modeswitch as soon as the default IDs are found
(when the device is plugged). Then add your new setup file to
"/etc/usb_modeswitch.d". But don't forget to report your success !!

Important: libusb programs - like this tool - need to be run as root!

Contribute
==========

USB-ModeSwitch comes quite handy for experimenting with your own hardware if
not supported yet. You could try this approach:

Note the device's Vendor and Product ID from /proc/bus/usb/devices (or from the
output of lsusb); the assigned driver is usually "usb-storage". Then try spying
on the USB communication to the device with the same ID inside M$ Windoze. I
recommend this tool:
"SniffUSB" (http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/index.php.en).

PLEASE post any improvements, new device information and/or bug reports to the
forum (see above) or send it to the author (see below)!
