History of USB-ModeSwitch
=========================

Version 1.1.3, 2010/06/21
    Added delay option to separate multiple message transfers by millisecs;
    fixed (possibly dangerous) sloppy string handling (thanks to Christophe
    Fergeau); added "clear_halt" for response endpoint; small additions in
    Makefile (install with -D); changes in option handling (NO MORE DEFAULT
    CONFIG FILE!) and help text; symlink feature in wrapper can now cope
    with devices providing more than one interrupt port; wrapper now ignores
    package manager leftovers in config folder; replaced bash-specific syntax
    in wrapper; changed ZTE skipping (if existing rules are found) to warning
Version 1.1.2, 2010/04/18
    Added support for two additional bulk messages; wrapper handles special
	ZTE case; generalized driver loading, new parameter "DriverModule" and
    "DriverIDPath"; new wrapper facility to add symlink pointing to interrupt
    port (used in rule file from data pack >= 20100418)
Version 1.1.1, 2010/03/17
    Attention: old usb_modeswitch.conf renamed to usb_modeswitch.setup!
    Add separate config file for wrapper (global settings for switching and
    logging); add config file option to disable driver loading; handling of
    kernel attribute AVOID_RESET_QUIRK added; bug fixed in SonyMode (reported
    by "no-0n3"); bug fixed in SuccessCheck logic; minor flow alignments and
    fixes; new devices
Version 1.1.0, 2010/01/24
    Attention: wrapper script location changed, uninstall old versions!
    Major fixes in the wrapper script (stabilizing and time-saving);
    back to unified installation, defaults to "integrated" approach;
    new -D parameter to enable "integrated" behaviour; bugs fixed in
    success check; man file included (borrowed from the Debian package);
    C code and binary works with the compat library from libusb-1.0;
    some new devices
Version 1.0.7, 2010/01/06
    Bug fixed for Sony mode, thanks to Marco Chiaranda; fix for parameter
    substitution in newer udev versions, fix for bad bug in wrapper script
    practically disabling automatic mode
Version 1.0.6, 2009/12/21
    New "GCT Mode", fixes for device quirks (NXP Dragonfly), fix for multiple
    Huawei devices, cleanups, loads of new devices in config file and database,
    minor tcl script changes
Version 1.0.5, 2009/08/26
    More changes and fixes regarding success check; "--version" option;
    config "database" updated
Version 1.0.4, 2009/08/23
    Success check bugs (and others) fixed
Version 1.0.3, 2009/08/20
    Success check improved; experimental system integration (fully automated),
    optional; new parameter "TargetProductList" needed for this; other
    necessary small adaptations; more devices
Version 1.0.2, 2009/06/10
    Output bugs fixed
Version 1.0.1, 2009/06/08
    Added output of descriptor strings for further identification
Version 1.0.0, 2009/06/01
    Attention: possible incompatibilities for command line control!
    On/off flags don't require arguments anymore (-H, -S, -O, -d, -R,
    -n, new: -I), meaning "-R 0" does a reset like "-R 1" or "-R";
    long option names changed to standard format (e.g. --HuaweiMode to
    --huawei-mode); added device inquiry, for future help with device
    identification; catch error -19 as possible success; send and response
    endpoints now autoselected (consequently NeedResponse is back);
