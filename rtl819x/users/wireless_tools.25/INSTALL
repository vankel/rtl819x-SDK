Very important note :
-------------------
	This release of the Wireless Tools is not compatible with Wireless
	Extensions earlier than 9.
	Kernels that support this version of the Wireless Tools are listed
	below. For all kernels before that, please use the version v19 of
	the Wireless Tools.
	You might have headers troubles and it doesn't compile, see below...

You need :
--------
	o Compiler and development environment
	o A kernel supporting wireless extensions version 9 or higher
		-> from 2.2.14 onward
		-> from 2.3.24 onward
		Note : CONFIG_NET_RADIO must be enabled
	o (Optional) A Pcmcia package supporting Wireless Extension
	o A driver supporting wireless extensions
		-> Check my web pages for latest list of drivers,
			otherwise patch your favourite driver...
	Note : more recent kernels and drivers are likely to support
		more wireless extension features...

Compile wireless tools :
----------------------
	In theory, a "make" should suffice to create the tools.
	In practice, there is big troubles with the kernel
headers. See below for how to fix that.
	Note : as some internal data structures change from kernel to
kernel, you are advised to not use the precompiled version of the
tools but to recompile your own.

Installation :
------------
	If I were you, I would not trust a "make install". If you feel
courageous, just do "make install". It may even do the right
thing. Actually, with the various bugfixes that happened over the
time, it nowadays tend to do the right thing.
	I advise to copy the executable (iwconfig, iwspy and iwpriv)
in /usr/local/sbin or /usr/sbin. The man pages (iwconfig.8, iwspy.8
and iwpriv.8) should be copied in /usr/local/man/man8 or
/usr/man/man8.
	In fact, if you want to use Pcmcia wireless.opts, this step is
mandatory...

Kernel headers (why it doesn't compile) :
---------------------------------------
	Some changes in the kernel headers and glibc headers are
making my life difficult. We now have a mechanism to automatically
select the proper header based on various bits of information (libc
version & kernel version), but it may fail to do the right thing.
	You may also see the message :
		"Your kernel/libc combination is not supported"
	If this happens to you, you will need to hack the rules at the
top of iwlib.h and send me the patch.

	The second issue is that some distributions install some
independant kernel headers in /usr/include. If you upgrade your
kernel, those headers become out of sync and you don't benefit from
the latest Wireless Extensions. Even worse, it can sometimes prevent
the tools from compiling.
	The trick is to copy the file .../include/linux/wireless.h
from the kernel to the /usr/include headers.
