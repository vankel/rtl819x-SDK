This is a development version of my free netbios client server for unix.

Please let me know if it works for you!

There is a mailing list for discussion of this software. To subscribe
send mail to lists@arvidsjaur.anu.edu.au with a body of "subscribe netbios"

To send mail to everyone on the list mail to netbios@arvidsjaur.anu.edu.au

The mail ftp distribution site for this software is nimbus.anu.edu.au
in the directory pub/tridge/server/.

This software is freely distributable under the GNU public license, a
copy of which you should have received with this software (in a file
called COPYING). If you like this software then please let me know.

If you want to contribute to the development of the software then
please join the mailing list. I'm definately looking for people to
help with the development.

You could also send hardware/software/money/jewelry or pizza vouchers
directly to me. The pizza vouchers would be especially welcome.

HOW TO TRY IT OUT
=================

STEP 1. install a smb client. There are several, eg: Pathworks, Lanmanager
for DOS, Lanmanager for Windows, Lanmanager for OS/2, and lanmanager
for NT come to mind. Lanmanager for dos is available via ftp from
ftp.microsoft.com in Advsys/MSclient/. Please read the licensing stuff
before downloading. Use the TCP/IP option in the client. Add your
server to the \etc\hosts (or equivalent) file on the client.

STEP 2. Install my server on a unix box. To do this edit the Makefile for
your flavour of unix and preferences then type "make". This will
create smbserver and smbclient.

STEP 3. Create the smb configuration file. There is a sample configuration file
called smb.conf.sample supplied with the distribution.

The simplest useful configuration file would be something like this:

[homes]
	guest ok = no
	read only = no

which would allow connections by anyone with an account on the server,
using their login name as the service name.

STEP 4. Test the unix server with the unix client, just to make sure it
works. You don't need root privilages for this. Do something like this:

smbserver -D -p 8001 -d 3 -s smb.conf -l log &

smbclient "\\yourhostname\aservicename" -p 8001 -d 3 -l client_log

It will ask you for a password. After answering you should get a
"connected" message and the smb> prompt. You can now do dir,get,put,cd
etc. If it doesn't work then look in the log file and try and find
out why.

NOTE: If your machine uses shadow passwords then you can only make
password queries if running as root. Thus you must use guest services
or run the server as root. You *could* make the server suid root, but
I don't recommend this as the server isn't really designed for it, and
it would probably be a security hole. Instead use guest services for
this initial testing then run the server as root from inetd.conf, or
as root with the -D switch.

STEP 5. Put the smbserver, nmbserver and smb configuration file in some
sensible place, like /usr/local/smb/.

STEP 6. Next choose a method for starting the server. Either you can place 
it in inetd.conf and have it started on demand by inetd, or you can start 
it as a daemon either from the command line or in /etc/rc.local

STARTING IT FROM INETD.CONF
===========================

Look at your /etc/services. What is defined at port 139/tcp. If
nothing is defined then add a line like this:

netbios-ssn     139/tcp

similarly for 137/udp you should have an entry like:

netbios-ns	137/udp

Next edit your /etc/inetd.conf and add two lines something like this:

netbios-ssn stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/smb/smbserver smbserver -s /usr/local/smb/smb.conf -l /usr/local/smb/log -d 1
netbios-ns dgram udp wait root /usr/local/smb/nmbserver nmbserver -d 1

or more simply:
netbios-ssn stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/smb/smbserver smbserver -d 1
netbios-ns dgram udp wait root /usr/local/smb/nmbserver nmbserver -d 1

assuming you compiled the appropriate paths in by putting them in the Makefile.

The exact syntax of /etc/inetd.conf varies between unixes. Look at the
other entries in inetd.conf for a guide.

NOTE: On some unixes you may need to give the nmbserver a -B parameter
to specify the broadcast address of your interface. Run ifconfig as
root if you don't know what the broadcast is for your net. nmbserver
tries to determine it at run time, but fails on some unixes.

Restart inetd, perhaps just send it a HUP.

ALTERNATIVE: STARTING IT AS A DAEMON
====================================

To start the server as a daemon you should create a script something
like this one, perhaps calling it "startsmb"

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/smb/smbserver -D -d 1
/usr/local/smb/nmbserver -D -d 1 -n YOURNETBIOSNAME

then make it executable with "chmod +x startsmb"

You can then run startsmb by hand or execute it from /etc/rc.local

To kill it send a kill signal to the processes nmbserver and smbserver.


STEP 7. try connecting with the unix client. eg:

smbclient "\\yourhostname\aservice" -d 3

STEP 8. Try connecting from a dos/NT/os-2 client. Try mounting disks. eg:

net use d: \\servername\service

Try printing. eg:

net use lpt1: \\servername\spoolservice
print filename

Celebrate, or send me a bug report!


PRINTING FROM UNIX
==================

To use a printer that is available via a smb server from a unix host
you will need to compile the smbclient program. You then need to
install the script "smbprint". Read the instruction in smbprint for
more details.
