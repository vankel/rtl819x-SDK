DISCLAIMER

WE TRY OUR BEST TO PROVIDE YOU WITH "REAL-WORLD" EXAMPLES BUT WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE THAT ALL CLIENT EXAMPLES CAN CONNECT TO THIRD PARTY WEB SERVICES
WHEN THESE SERVICES ARE DOWN OR HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

MS WINDOWS

For Windows users, the archive includes 'magic_VC' and 'quote_VC' Visual
Studio projects in the 'samples' directory.

SSL

To try the SSL-secure SOAP server, install OpenSSL and change the occurrences
of "linprog2.cs.fsu.edu" in sslclient.c and sslserver.c to the machine name
(or machine IP) you are using. Example .pem files are included but you need to
create your own .pem files (see OpenSSL documentation).

The sslclient and sslserver codes can then be build as follows:

soapcpp2 -c ssl.h
gcc -DWITH_OPENSSL -o sslclient sslclient.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapClient.c -lssl -lcrypto
gcc -DWITH_OPENSSL -o sslserver sslserver.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapServer.c -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread
