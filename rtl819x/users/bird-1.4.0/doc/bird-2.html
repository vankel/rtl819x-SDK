<P>BIRD has one or more routing tables which may or may not be
synchronized with OS kernel and which may or may not be synchronized with
each other (see the Pipe protocol). Each routing table contains a list of
known routes. Each route consists of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>network prefix this route is for (network address and prefix length -- the number of bits forming the network part of the address; also known as a netmask)</LI>
<LI>preference of this route</LI>
<LI>IP address of router which told us about this route</LI>
<LI>IP address of router we should forward the packets to
using this route</LI>
<LI>other attributes common to all routes</LI>
<LI>dynamic attributes defined by protocols which may or
may not be present (typically protocol metrics)</LI>
</UL>
<P>Routing table maintains multiple entries
for a network, but at most one entry for one network and one
protocol. The entry with the highest preference is used for routing (we
will call such an entry the <I>selected route</I>). If
there are more entries with the same preference and they are from the same
protocol, the protocol decides (typically according to metrics). If they aren't,
an internal ordering is used to break the tie. You can
get the list of route attributes in the Route attributes section.
<P>
<P>Each protocol is connected to a routing table through two filters
which can accept, reject and modify the routes. An <I>export</I>
filter checks routes passed from the routing table to the protocol,
an <I>import</I> filter checks routes in the opposite direction.
When the routing table gets a route from a protocol, it recalculates
the selected route and broadcasts it to all protocols connected to
the table. The protocols typically send the update to other routers
in the network. Note that although most protocols are interested 
in receiving just selected routes, some protocols (e.g. the <CODE>Pipe</CODE>
protocol) receive and process all entries in routing tables (accepted
by filters).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="dsc-sorted"></A> Usually, a routing table just chooses a
selected route from a list of entries for one network. But if the
<CODE>sorted</CODE> option is activated, these lists of entries are kept
completely sorted (according to preference or some protocol-dependent
metric).
<P>This is needed for some features of some protocols
(e.g. <CODE>secondary</CODE> option of BGP protocol, which allows to accept
not just a selected route, but the first route (in the sorted list)
that is accepted by filters), but it is incompatible with some other
features (e.g. <CODE>deterministic med</CODE> option of BGP protocol, which
activates a way of choosing selected route that cannot be described
using comparison and ordering). Minor advantage is that routes are
shown sorted in <CODE>show route</CODE>, minor disadvantage is that it is
slightly more computationally expensive.
