================================================================================

The BIRD project is an attempt to create a routing daemon running on UNIX-like
systems (but not necessarily limited to them) with full support of all modern
routing protocols, easy to use configuration interface and powerful route
filtering language.

If you want to help us debugging, enhancing and porting BIRD or just lurk
around to see what's going to develop from this strange creature, feel free
to subscribe to the BIRD users mailing list (bird-users@bird.network.cz),
send subscribes to majordomo at the same machine).  Bug reports, suggestions,
feature requests (: and code :) are welcome.

You can download the latest version from ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird/
and look at the BIRD home page at http://bird.network.cz/.

BIRD development started as a student project at the Faculty of Math
and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic under supervision
of RNDr. Libor Forst <forst@cuni.cz>. BIRD has been developed and supported
by CZ.NIC z.s.p.o. http://www.nic.cz/ since 2009.

How to install BIRD:

	./configure
	make
	make install
	vi /usr/local/etc/bird.conf

Online documentation is available as HTML files in the doc directory,
you can install it by `make install-docs' and rebuild it by `make docs',
but for the latter you need SGMLtools and LaTeX to be installed on your
machine. You can also download a neatly formatted PostScript version
as a separate archive (bird-doc-*.tar.gz).

What do we support:

	o  Both IPv4 and IPv6 (use --enable-ipv6 when configuring)
	o  Multiple routing tables
	o  BGP
	o  RIP
	o  OSPF
	o  Static routes
	o  Inter-table protocol
	o  IPv6 router advertisements
	o  Command-line interface (using the `birdc' client; to get
	   some help, just press `?')
	o  Soft reconfiguration -- no online commands for changing the
	   configuration in very limited ways, just edit the configuration
	   file and issue a `configure' command or send SIGHUP and BIRD
	   will start using the new configuration, possibly restarting
	   protocols affected by the configuration changes.
	o  Powerful language for route filtering (see doc/bird.conf.example).

What is missing:

	o  See the TODO list

Good Luck and enjoy the BIRD :)
