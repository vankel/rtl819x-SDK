PLEASE REPORT NEW DEVICES



This is a data package to complement the full release package of
USB_ModeSwitch, a tool to switch multi-mode (or composite) USB devices.
It is used since usb-modeswitch version 1.0.3.

Recommended version of usb-modeswitch package is 1.1.2 and above. Some
devices contained here may not be switched with older versions, even if
they will not cause any error.


Explanation about config file names:
====================================

Names consist of <VendorID>:<ProductID>, respective to the default device
mode.
Should more detailed identification become necessary, one or more attributes
to test can be attached after further colons:
<VendorID>:<ProductID>:<Attribute>=<String>[:<Attribute>=<String> ...]

The strings match if they are part of the attribute content. Use "_"
to match spaces (it will match "_" too!).

Currently recognized attibutes are:

uMa = USB, iManufacturer
uPr = USB, iProduct
uSe = USB, iSerial
sVe = SCSI, Vendor
sMo = SCSI, Model
sRe = SCSI, Revision

This list is easily extendable if necessary.

Example:
<vid>:<pid>:uPr=CDMA_Mo will match iProduct "CDMA Modem" or "MyCDMA_Mordor"


If information is missing about ambiguous devices, a ":?" is attached
to the file/ID in question. Please contact the forum if you need help
in such a case.


Notes about specific devices:
=============================

- 16d8:6803 (C-motech D50, CDU-680): two versions popped up; one with
  ID unchanged, target class 0xff, providing standard serial ports,
  and one with target product 0x680a, providing an ACM port. There is
  not enough information how to tell them apart; if you have the second
  one, we badly need information (usb_modeswitch output with SCSI inquiry)

- 1004:607f (LG KP500): switching message derived from report but untested

- 1266:1000 (Royaltek Q110): switching method very likely but unconfirmed
