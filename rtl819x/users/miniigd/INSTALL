=============================== Linux =================================
To Build and install :

- make sure you have libiptc available on your system
- edit and run linux/iptables_init.sh shell script.
  This script must allways be run before the daemon
  to set up intial rules and chains.
- Build the daemon
  > make -f Makefile.linux
- install as root using :
  > make -f Makefile.linux install PREFIX=/usr/local
- run as root.
- anytime, you can use the linux/iptables_flush.sh
  script to flush all rules added by the daemon.
- after killing the daemon, you can get back to
  iptables initial state by runing the linux/iptables_removeall.sh
  script. Don't forget to edit the script to your convinience.

All options are set using the command line.
To stop the daemon use :
  > kill `cat /var/run/miniupnpd.pid`
