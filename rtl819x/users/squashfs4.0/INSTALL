			INSTALLING SQUASHFS

The squashfs4.0.tar.gz file contains the squashfs-tools directory containing
mksquashfs and unsquashfs.

1. Patching the kernel
----------------------

This release is for 2.6.29 only.  Kernel patching is not necessary.

2. Building squashfs tools
--------------------------

The squashfs-tools directory contains the mksquashfs and unsquashfs programs.
These can be made by typing make.  The source files use a local copy of
squashfs_fs.h (included in the kernel patches) allowing the tools to be made
without needing to patch the kernel.
