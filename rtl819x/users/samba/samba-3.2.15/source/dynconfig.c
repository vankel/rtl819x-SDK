/**
 * @file dynconfig.c
 *
 * @brief Global configurations, initialized to configured defaults.
 *
 * This file should be the only file that depends on path
 * configuration (--prefix, etc), so that if ./configure is re-run,
 * all programs will be appropriately updated.  Everything else in
 * Samba should import extern variables from here, rather than relying
 * on preprocessor macros.
 *
 * Eventually some of these may become even more variable, so that
 * they can for example consistently be set across the whole of Samba
 * by command-line parameters, config file entries, or environment
 * variables.
 *
 * @todo Perhaps eventually these should be merged into the parameter
 * table?  There's kind of a chicken-and-egg situation there...
