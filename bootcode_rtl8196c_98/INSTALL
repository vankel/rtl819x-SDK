0. Introduction	
   This file will show you how to build the boot code for RTL8651c system. 
Besides, It will guide you how to download the built image to Realtek EV 
(Evaluation) board. PLEASE NOTE, the update of boot code is very dangerous 
because the EV board may not be booted any more if the boot code is corrupted.

1. Build Environment 
   RedHat 7.3/9.0

2. Toolchain
   You have to install the RSDK toolchain in advance.

3. Build boot code and boot code loader

3.0 choose hardware target:
   - ==> if choosing the "RTL8651", please execute the command.
	 >cp def-rtl8651-config .config
   - ==> Or, if choosing the "RTL8652", please execute the command.
	 >cp def-rtl8652-config .config 
3.1 make menuconfig 
   - ==> choose the hardware setting (RTL865x/8652) and memeory setting.
   - ==> choose compressing tool(LZMA is default enable).
3.2 make
   - ==> boot is the binary file of boot code   
   - ==> boot.bin is the image file for auto burn 
   	 (Header is included for checksum checking)
 

4. Burn boot code image to Realtek EV board
   - Use a RS232 cable to connect COM port between a LINUX PC and EV board.
   - Connect LINUX PC Ethernet port to the LAN port of EV board. Set PC IP
     address to 192.168.1.x (e.g., type 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1').
   - Start a COM port console (e.g., minicom), and set COM port setting to 
     38400, 8N1 and no flow control.
   - Power on EV board, and press 'ESC' key in COM port console to escape the 
     booting process. If ok, you may see "<RealTek>" prompt in the console.
   - Start a TFTP client in LINUX PC, and connect to 192.168.1.6. Set file 
     type to binary mode, and put boot file (boot) to TFTP server of EV 
     board.
   - After TFTP upload is completed, you may see a message in COM port
     console as "**TFTP Client Upload File Size = 0000xxxx Bytes at 80300000".
     "0000xxxx" and "80300000" indicate the hex value of upload file size and 
     memory address stored image respectively. 
   - Type command in COM port console as "flw 0 80300000 xxxx" to write upload
     image to flash address "0" from SDRAM address "80300000" with size "xxxx"
     in hex.
   - Then that, you may see a message shown in COM port console as: 
     "Flash Program from 80300000 to 00000000 with 0000xxxx bytes     ?
     (Y)es, (N)o->". Type 'y' to confirm the writing. After the updated is
     completed, you could power off/on the EV board, and the new boot code
     will be effective.
